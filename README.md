## About me
Hello and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Akshay Sharma and I am a CPA turned Data Scientist. I have a strong fundamental background in finance having audited large financial institutions before setting my sights on developing more technical skills in analytics. I decided to pivot my career and skill up in Data Science tools through a full time bootcamp at Flatiron School. As such, I bring a unique perspective of paying meticulous attention to the datasets I work with due to my prior experience of scrutinizing my client's financial records to find key insights. I have been working as a Data Scientist at IBM for over 2 years now where I have led client engagements to co-create technical solutions that solve business workflow problems, enhance decision making through analytics, and presented to key technical and non-technical stakeholders.
